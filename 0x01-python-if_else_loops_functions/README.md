# Python - if/else, loops, functions

In this project, I began utilizing conditionals and loops in Python by using `if`,
`if ... else`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, and `range` statements with `while` and
`for` loops. I practiced writing my own Python functions while learning about scope of
variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
  * [0-positive_or_negative.py](./0-positive_or_negative.py): Python program that assigns
  a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and
  prints whether `number` is positive or negative.
  * Prints the number followed by:
    * If the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
    * If the number is 0: `is zero`
    * If the number is less than 0: `is negative`
    * Followed by a new line.
  * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py).

* **1. The last digit**
  * [1-last_digit.py](./1-last_digit.py): Python program that assigns a random signed number
  to the variable `number` each time it is executed and prints its last digit.
  * Prints the string `Last digit of [number] is [last_digit]` followed by:
